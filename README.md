CFR (Căile Ferate Române) is Romania's national railway carrier. As with a lot of things, their website is plain awful. It mostly fails at:

- Mobile view, some parts are hidden and cannot be scrolled to.
- No shareable links.

This is both a Python library for accessing their train schedules through a clean API and provides the source code for the website `https://cfr.ninja`, which is a much improved way of viewing CFR's train schedules.
