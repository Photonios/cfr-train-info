# CFR Train Info

CFR (Căile Ferate Române) is Romania's national railway carrier. As with a lot of things, their website is plain awful. It mostly fails at:

- Mobile view, some parts are hidden and cannot be scrolled to.
- No shareable links.

This small Python library provides an interface to the CRF website.
